# 🔮 Customer Churn Prediction Model

## 📋 Project Overview
Created a machine learning model to predict customer churn using classification algorithms and customer behavioral data.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook | Excel

## 🧠 Process
1. Cleaned and preprocessed customer data.  
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find key churn indicators.  
3. Built and compared multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).  
4. Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics.

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **82% model accuracy**.  
- Identified top 5 churn factors improving retention strategy insights.
